# ECE-202-Miniproject-1
Part (a). Use method of moments to determine charge
distribution on a very thin charged rectangular plate with a
= 1 m, at potential V0 = 1 V. Subdivide the plate into n x m
square patches such that n = 10 and m = 20. Calculate total
charge on the plate and plot the charge distribution.
Part (b). Use method of moments to determine charge
distribution on a very thin charged plate with shape shown
in figure on the right, with characteristic dimension a = 1 m,
at potential V0 = 1 V. Subdivide the plate into square
patches of same patch size as in Part (a). Calculate total
charge on the plate and plot the charge distribution.
